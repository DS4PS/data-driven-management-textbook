# A Tale of Two Data-Driven Management Systems: Amazon and Zappos 

## Topic Overview
The articles below examine the use of data and their effects on management. From the tightly controlled business at Amazon to the more freely run Zappos, these articles attempt to show the use of data on measuring employee effectiveness, employee retention, and morale. Both Amazon and Zappos are highly successful, but each has a very different philosophy. These different environments are even more strange since Amazon owns Zappos!

## Chapter Summaries


O’Neil, C. (2016). Weapons of math destruction: How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy. Broadway Books. CH7 sweating bullets
The article in Weapons of math destruction is broken into 3 distinct subchapters. The first section deals with how data is used to impact the workforce. In the article, workers in the food service and retail industry were examined. The article asserts that 2/3 of food service and ½ of retail workers receive their schedule less than one week before it starts. This is done with the help of scheduling technology using Operations Research (OR). The technology matches employees to the busiest times, hours available, and other business needs. As a result, employees have a challenge maintaining a routine which inhibits activities like attending college, spending time with children, or managing child care. The effect on their children is quite similar, a lack of routines. The varied schedule was linked to sleep deprivation and heightened anxiety. Some employees have to close a business and open it the next morning, termed “clopening.” This technology also works to limit employees less than 30 hours, so they often do not receive benefits. The inability for these workers to advance themselves enhances the inequalities in the system while maximizing profits for the business. 
The Second section is focused on employee metrics. A company called Cataphora designed algorithms that could scour emails and other data to identify the best idea generators in the workforce. These algorithms would rank employees for management, so they could determine, through technology, the best workers. During the recession of 2008, this data was used to identify who to lay off. This technology used assumptions and often without other types of manager input. The technology had a low correlation to employee performance. The potential outcome of this technology could have been the culling of very effective employees from the businesses. Cataphora went out of business.
In the third section, a review of the testing of students and monitoring of teachers in response to the 1983 report “A Nation at Risk” by the Regan administration. The report warned of a “rising tide of mediocrity” in our nation’s schools. Tests were used to determine teacher effectiveness with one major flaw. The tests were not measured on an absolute scale. Scores were inaccurately tied to school type, social inequality, and a failed try at fairness. Teachers scores varied wildly from year to year although the learning plans and lessons taught remained the same. One teacher examined in the article scored a 6 out of 100 one year and 96 out of 100 the next year. Nothing about his style had changed. In addition, the reporting of lower SAT scores was examined. The total overall score had changed, however the assumptions were incorrect. Over time, the number of students taking the test expanded greatly. When each subgroup of test taker was examined, each area had shown improvement which is called Simpson’s Paradox. The total was lower, but each subgroup improved.

This article discusses the idea of “holocracy” and how it was successfully implemented at the Zappos company. The idea behind it was to create more autonomy in the employees while maintaining the small-firm culture in a big-firm environment.  Holocratic governance is compared to cell biology. Each of your cells works on its own without asking other cells for permissions to do anything. He seeks adaptability and nimbleness in his companies that focuses on the groups interests and not individual interests. This workplace is more employee centered with the idea that happy employees have a “trickle down” effect when it comes with handling customer requests.

This worked well for Zappos because without the structure of a hierarchy employees are empowered and understand the meaning of their work and have purpose instead of menial goals. Holocracy is a style or work that relies on autonomy and self-governance. When Zappos decided to make the change to a holocratic environment, bosses were no longer needed. Zappos gave each employee the ability to opt out of this culture shift by offering a buyout of those who didn’t want to “participate.” 14% of the workforce took this offer. Each member joins teams to solve issues or create programs. Every employee has an equal say and the decisions are made where the information is rather than through a hierarchal structure.  

## Key Take-Aways (for Yellowdig)



### Discussion Questions
Discussion Question: Do the risks of bad data or assumptions outweigh the benefits of using data to identify workplace effeciencies or employee performance?

Discussion Question: Would holocracy, where there is no management, and a design that emphasizes autonomy and self-governance work in your agency? How would this benefit your Agency and what risks would it bring?
