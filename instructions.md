## Drafting Your Chapter

You are responsible for creating chapters that present key insights for each topic. The purpose of the exercise is to work collaboratively to create a robust set of notes that can serve as a future reference guide so you can remind yourself about details of the course or quickly identify chapters or articles you want to revisit. Different topics might require different approaches (some lend themselves to check-lists or best-practices, while others might focus on clearly articulating an idea or area of research.). 

In general, I would recomment approaching the assignment as an opportunity to make yourself into an expert on your topic, then sharing your knowledge in a _**clear**_ and _**concise**_ manner with classmates and the general public. Your name will be on each chapter, so submit something that you are willing to own. 

Your chapter should have three parts:

## Topic Overview (approximately 1-3 pages)

What are the key insights from the readings, and how do they relate to building data-driven organizations? 

Summarize the themes and insights that are common across the readings. Organize them into a coherent topic overview, summarizing the main arguments made by authors. 

Make sure to reference the evidence and data the authors use to support their arguments, when appropriate. 

Go beyond a summary and offer your own analysis of how the material helps us build data-driven organizations, including some framework for best practices or things to consider. 


## Summaries (approximately 0.5 pages each)

Provide summaries of key arguments and insights provided in each chapter or article you were responsible for. This should be short, typically about half a page. Summaries will vary by content - sometime content is best organized with a few paragraphs of text, others with itemized lists, and in other cases you might want to include graphics or diagrams illustrate content. 


## Video and Discussion Points

1. Record a short 2-5 minute video presenting a key insight or the main take-aways from your section. The video can be of a team member, or a screen shot of power point slides or graphics as you explain your points.  
2. Upload the video to YouTube, and insert an iframe of the video into your document. 
3. Draft some guiding questions for things managers or policy-makers should consider.  
4. Post the video and discussion questions to YellowDig with a link to your completed chapter. 

In YouTube, you will find iframes by clicking on the Share option, and the "Embed" icon.

Paste this text into your markdown document, and it will add the video to your page:

```
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VVRHTF5Ikro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```


## Adding Images

If you want to include images you need to add the image file to the [images folder](https://github.com/DS4PS/data-driven-management-textbook/tree/master/images) in this repository. Web-friendly formats like PNG, JPEG, or GIF are preferred. 

You can just drag and drop the images into the folder, and GitHub will automatically initiate an upload option. After the upload progress bar is complete, click on the green "Commit changes" icon to complete the upload process.

You will then reference images in text using markdown syntax (see the Markddown Guide above for more details):
